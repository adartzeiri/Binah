1)  Architecture -  I chose to use MVVM design pattern as the main architecture including DI technique. Binding is performed by Closures.

2) I wrote network infrastructure that uses Apple native URLSession and can be change vary easly to any other 3th party library. It includes some nice features as : Logger, Cancel, Progress observer etc.

3) This is my first time using Coordinator pattern and sure that there are things that can be improved.

** Disclaimer ** 
For this project i did not use any kind of constant or Localizable file, instead of , i used  hardcoded values so dont worry about that.

If you guys have any futrher questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
